# Wharf RFCs (Request For Comments)

For any substantial change that needs to be thought through in Wharf, we try to
use RFCs for them instead of internally trying to talk it out in meetings.

Not every decision needs an RFC, nor is any RFC excessive. This is the
start of our journey with RFCs, so we're trying to limit them to changes with
major impact.

## Getting started

Please visit the [RFC life cycle](./_guides/rfc-life-cycle.md) and
[Writing RFCs](./_guides/writing-rfcs.md) pages to learn about how you can
start proposing RFCs yourself.

## Disclaimer

The documents and markdown files in this repository are documentation of our
decision making. Only to have a place to look back at, similar to meeting
notes or recordings, so we can see our previous decisions.

**It is not** documentation of how things are meant to be implemented. Do not
take this repository as the source of truth of how Wharf works. Please check
out our [Wharf documentation](https://iver-wharf.github.io/) or the
[source code](https://github.com/iver-wharf/) itself to gain the actual source
of truth.
